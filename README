[introduction]
"LithoTransform" is used to create pictures of lithostratigraphic columns (png-
-format) and their respective world files (pgw-format) as georeference. All 
config- and your data-csv-file should be placed in the "TRANSFORM"-folder.

The whole folder provides real examples for the configuration of the program
and the input of your own data. For further information read the following
descriptions:

[config.csv]
To set some important configurations you may open "config.csv". The
names, values and descriptions of the entries are {tab}-seperated.
This shouldn't be changed as in any other file used by the program.
"MetersPerMapUnit"  --> how many meters per map unit of your projection
						(i.e. "0.001"[m/Â°])
"width_max"			--> width of all lithological columns in pixels [px]
						(for now there is no option to assign different
						widths to different columns or litho-units)
"height_max"		--> height of the biggest lithological column of 
						whole dataset in pixel [px]		
"inverse"			--> choose whether to plot strata inverse (1) or 
						normal (0) as given by dataset (inverse is amongst
						other things important for the following "QGIS_fix")
"QGIS_fix"			--> choose whether to use fix for later plotting in QGIS 
						(1) or not (0) -> changes world files so that litho-
						column is plottet one of it's own height below original 
						position to fit graphically under the real position in 
						QGIS --> take care to also activate "inverse" for this
						fix to be complete

[data.csv]						
To aquire a successfull run of the program you have to provide a file
called "data.csv" which contains your inputdata in the given format:
There are no text-limiters ("" are often used as default by many spread-
sheet-software) but a {tab}-column-delimiter. Do not use another! The
first line of the file must contain at least the following entries in
any order: 
"Nr."			--> number or name of location (all litho-units share of 
					one locaito share the same Nr.; pictures and world 
					files will use these numbers or names as file names)
"X" and "Y"		--> the X- and Y-coordinates of each location (can only be in
					format of a number, i.e. "-31.22" or "5120000")
"Depth_max"		--> maximal depth of each locations lithological column
"From" and "To"	--> From where To which depth in the litho-column your given
					unit reaches (i.e. from "5.1" to "10.22" meters depth)
Lithology		--> lithology of your unit (i.e. "marl", "sandy clay")
Further columns with different names are not supported and will be ignored
by the program.

[litho.csv]
To change colors of your strata open and edit "litho.csv". The colors
are given in hexadecimal-format. A {tab}-delimiter is used to seperate
the color from the name of their respective lithology. Take care that
you spell the lithologies here exactly like in your data.csv and don't
miss some!

[Java]
This program needs the Java Virtual Machine to function. Be sure to have 
the newest version of Java installed. If something doe not function 
correctly, please consider get the newest Java-Version from http://www.oracle.com. 

[starting the program]
Just doubleblick "LithoTransform.jar" in the same folder as the manual.
Alternatively open your command prompt (i.e. cmd.exe in Windows). There
you open the directory with command cd "the whole path to the directory"
(without the ""). Now you can use the command "java -jar LithoTransform"
to start the program. This will also give you some information about
what the program is doing (shown in the command prompt). After starting
LithoTransform.jar a blue progress bar on red background will show how
many of all lithologies have already been drawn. When the program is
finished the whole display will be green and you can close the window by
pressing the x-button or in another way suiting your needs.
